Financial and Election Data Analysis
---
**Oveview**

The repository contains two Python-based projects designed to analyze financial and election data. The first project, PyBank, evaluates financial performance based on monthly profit and loss data from [specific financial data source]. The second project, PyPoll, determines election results based on polling data from [specific election data source].
Both projects read data from CSV files, process it, and generate user-friendly summary reports, output as text files for easy access and review.

PyBank Analysis
---
**Purpose**

The PyBank project is focused on reviewing a company's financial records over a specific period. It calculates the total number of months in the dataset and the overall net profit or loss. It computes the average monthly changes in profits and losses and identifies the months with the most significant profit increase and the largest decrease. These results are presented in a concise report.

**Example Output**

A report generated by PyBank will include the total months, the cumulative profit or loss, the average monthly change, and details on the most significant increase and decrease in profits, along with the corresponding months.

PyPoll Analysis
---
**Purpose**

PyPoll is designed to analyze polling data from an election and summarize the results. It provides a breakdown of the total number of votes cast, lists all candidates who received votes, and calculates the percentage of votes each candidate won. The final output also declares the winner based on the candidate who received the most votes.

**Example Output**

The PyPoll analysis will generate a summary that includes the total number of votes, the vote percentage and count for each candidate, and the winning candidate's name.

This project utilizes Python 3.7+ and its built-in CSV module to read data from CSV files. The OS module also handles file paths and manages directories where output files are saved.
